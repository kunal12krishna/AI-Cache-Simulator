## 🚀 Overview  

**AI Cache Simulator** is a Python-based system that models CPU cache behavior while integrating **real-time AI-driven anomaly detection**.  
It provides a visual and interactive platform to analyze cache performance — showing hits, misses, replacement policy behavior, and performance anomalies as they occur.  

Traditional cache simulators only show numbers.  
This project brings cache analysis to life with **live visualization, adaptive behavior, and AI-based insights**.

## 🎯 Project Goals  

- Simulate CPU cache (Direct Mapped / Set Associative / Fully Associative).  
- Support configurable parameters (cache size, block size, replacement policy).  
- Integrate **AI module** for real-time **anomaly detection** in cache performance.  
- Provide an interactive **dashboard** to visualize hits, misses, and cache states.  
- Improve understanding of caching mechanisms and system performance.
